# ReadAndWriteMemory-StaticLibToolKit

##Enjoy :)
 
 	Test based on the use of functions from the "Bypass-CrackMe-Cruehead" repository, 
	with an example of how to make a simple crack in the "CrackMe" cruehead, through 
	the "rw" function library. 
	
		
## STEPS:
	
		1. Properies > VC directories > include directories - link to exemple: "C:\user\lib\include"
		2. Properies > VC directories > include library - link to exemple: "C:\user\lib\lib"
    
## Functions lib:
		
		1. GetPid					(ReadWriteLib::ToolKit::GetPID)
		2. OpenProcessByName				(ReadWriteLib::ToolKit::OpenProcessByName)
